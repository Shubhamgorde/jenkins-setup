Whats Jenkins?
- written in java
- allows continuous integration.



Prerequisites:
- Java 8 (either a JRE or Java Development Kit (JDK) is fine)
- Docker -Please refer the docker-installation document for this. (navigate to Get Docker at the top of the website to access the Docker download that’s suitable for your platform)

Install jenkins:
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt-get update
(Note:For ubuntu 18.04 or later, it defaults to java 9, whereas jenkins uses java 8.
You need to install jdk 8 before installing jenkins if issue occurs.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt install oracle-java8-installer
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-add-repository "deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/"
